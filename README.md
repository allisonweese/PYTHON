Fictional assignment for Career Foundry

I was an analyst for Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. While Instacart already had very good sales, I wanted to uncover more information about our sales patterns. My task was to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of our data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.
